### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2 part 2, was one of my favorite labs. Although this lab was one of if not the simplest labs, it was one of the first coding assignments I have done. This felt like the gateway into coding, and made me feel as though I was really doing something. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, was also one of my favorite labs because I felt as though this is where things started to pick up steam. I feel as though the previous labs before this one were pretty straight forward with most of it being cin and cout statements. Being able to manipulate the inputs and outputs with short simple lines of code was very fun. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 1, was my final favorite lab because it was the accumulation of all the skills I learned this semester. It was nice to see a final finished product that's actually pleasing to the eye. Unlike our other assignments that just printed text onto the terminal, the array of colors made me feel like I actually created something.
